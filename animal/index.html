<div class="block2-color-left"><p>Description</p></div>
<div class="block2-color-right"><p>The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body
    and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body 
    that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found 
    in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait 
    among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs
     little from over hair.Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134 cm 
     (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length, stand 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24 in) 
     tall at the withers, and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb),
      with an average in the Venezuelan llanos of 48.9 kg (108 lb). Females 
      are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded weights are 91 kg 
      (201 lb) for a wild female from Brazil and 73.5 kg (162 lb) for a 
      wild male from Uruguay. Also, an 81 kg individual was reported 
      in São Paulo in 2001 or 2002. The dental formula is 
     1.0.1.3
     1.0.1.3
     . Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails. 
     Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; 
     they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front 
     feet. Their muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and
      ears are near the top of their heads.</p></div>
